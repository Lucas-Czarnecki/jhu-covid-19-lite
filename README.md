# A cleaned and smaller-sized repo featuring Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 Data 

This repository contains cleaned daily reports from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. More specifically, it contains cleaned data from a previous project of mine that would process JHU data in a consistent format. You can find my original repository [HERE](https://github.com/Lucas-Czarnecki/COVID-19-CLEANED-JHUCSSE). 

The purpose of this repository is to create a smaller-sized version of my original repository for future projects. I've made this repo public as it may be of interest to others. If you wish to review the operations used to clean the original data from JHU, please see the original repo [HERE](https://github.com/Lucas-Czarnecki/COVID-19-CLEANED-JHUCSSE).
